1) CompareLinearWithNonlinear:
	Compares a linear model with the nonlinear one.

2) SimLinearModel
	Simulates the linear model (and truncated one) obtained when settting Projection=1

3) SimLinearWithoutProjectionModel
	Simulates the linear model obtained when setting Projection=0

4) TestPower
	Simulates different cases and the results can indicate if the power
	expression is correct or not.

5) Solutions2DEffect
	Contains two methods which can reduce the 2D effect .

6) CompareNonlinearWithSowfa
	Compared Sowfa simulation restuls with WFSim simulation results.


7) SimQlpvWithoutProjectionModel
	Simulates the qlpv-model obtained when setting Projection=0.

8) Compare finite difference linear model with analytic linear model.



To do:

1) Check all indices in WFSim
